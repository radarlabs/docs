</Alert>

Fraud detects GPS spoofing, proxy and VPN usage, and device tampering.

You can use Fraud with [Regions](/documentation/regions) to detect a user's country and state and mark specific regions as allowed or denied to comply with regulations.

Together, Fraud and Regions provide the following user context:

```json
{
  fraud: {
    passed: false,
    bypassed: false,
    verified: true,
    mocked: true,
    jumped: false,
    compromised: false,
    proxy: false,
    sharing: false
  },
  country: {
    name: "United States",
    flag: "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
    allowed: true
  },
  state: {
    code: "MD",
    name: "Maryland"
    allowed: false
  }
}
```

## How it works

You can call `Radar.trackOnce()` to accurately detect a user's current [geofences](/documentation/geofences), current [place](/documentation/places), or current [country and state](/documentation/regions).

However, users can spoof a device's location. For example, a gambling app user may spoof their location to access sports betting features only available in specific states. Or, a retail app user may spoof their location to access offers only available inside a store geofence.

To ensure you can trust a user's location, you can call `Radar.trackVerified()` instead. Radar will collect a variety of fraud signals and perform fraud checks, exposing flags that you can use for fraud detection and location verification in your app.

## Fraud flags

If you call `Radar.trackVerified()`, Radar exposes the following flags in `user.fraud`:
- `mocked`: Indicates whether a user's location is being mocked, such as in a simulator or using a location spoofing app (e.g., [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en_US&gl=US))
- `compromised`: Indicates whether the user's device or app has been compromised according to the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) on Android
- `jumped`: Indicates whether the user moved too far too fast (e.g., jumping across the country in only a few seconds)
- `sharing`: Indicates whether the user is screen sharing (e.g., using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/))
- `proxy`: Indicates whether the user's IP address is a known proxy, VPN, Tor exit node, etc.
- `verified`: Indicates whether the request was made with SSL pinning (i.e., no man-in-the-middle attack)

While you can work with individual flags, Radar also exposes a number of configurable flags to make your code simpler:
- `passed`: Indicates whether all fraud checks passed
- `bypassed`: Indicates whether a user's device has been bypassed for testing
- `blocked`: Indicates whether a user's device has been manually blocked

## Allowed states and countries

You can mark specific states and countries as allowed or denied to comply with regulations. For example, a gambling app may only be allowed to operate in specific states.

If you call `Radar.trackVerified()`, Radar exposes your settings in `user.country.allowed` and `user.state.allowed`.

## Configuring SSL pinning

To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the Radar SDK supports SSL pinning.

On iOS, add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSPinnedDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>api-verified.radar.io</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSPinnedLeafIdentities</key>
            <array>
                <dict>
                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>
                    <string>15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</string>
                </dict>
                <dict>
                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>
                    <string>15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</string>
                </dict>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

On Android, add a `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">api-verified.radar.io</domain>
        <pin-set>
            <pin digest="SHA-256">15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</pin>
            <pin digest="SHA-256">15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</pin>
        </pin-set>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

## Verifying a user's location

Client-side, you can verify a user's location with just a few lines of code:

<Tabs
  groupId="trip-tracking"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift' },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="swift">

```swift
Radar.trackVerified { (status, location, events, user) in
    if user?.fraud?.passed == true &&
        user?.country?.allowed == true &&
        user?.state?.allowed == true {
        // allow access to feature
    } else {
        // deny access to feature
    }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
Radar.trackVerified { status, location, events, user ->
    if (user?.fraud?.passed == true &&
        user.country?.allowed == true &&
        user.state?.allowed == true) {
        // allow access to feature
    } else {
        // deny access to feature        
    }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Alert alertType="warning">
  Fraud is not yet supported with `Radar.startTracking()`.
</Alert>

Server-side, you can also [get a user](/documentation/api#get-a-user) and check fraud flags server-side for an additional layer of verification:

```bash
curl "https://api.radar.io/v1/users/56db1f4613012711002229f4" \
  -H "Authorization: prj_live_sk_..."
```
