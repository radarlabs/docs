With Fraud, you can detect GPS spoofing, proxy and VPN usage, and device tampering.

Along with [Regions](/documentation/regions), you can also detect a user's country and state and mark specific regions as allowed or denied to comply with regulations.

Together, Fraud and Regions provide the following user context:

```json
{
  "fraud": {
    "passed": false,
    "bypassed": false,
    "verified": true,
    "mocked": true,
    "jumped": false,
    "compromised": false,
    "proxy": false,
    "sharing": false
  },
  "country": {
    "code": "US",
    "name": "United States",
    "flag": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
    "allowed": true
  },
  "state": {
    "code": "MD",
    "name": "Maryland",
    "allowed": false
  }
}
```

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, enable Fraud on the [Settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

From there, [integrate the SDK](/documentation/sdk), complete the steps below, and call `Radar.trackVerified()`. Radar will expose fraud flags in the callback as described below.

## How it works

You can call `Radar.trackOnce()` to accurately detect a user's current [geofences](/documentation/geofences), current [place](/documentation/places), or current [country and state](/documentation/regions).

However, users can spoof a device's location. For example, a gambling app user may spoof their location to access sports betting features only available in specific states. Or, a retail app user may spoof their location to access offers only available inside a store geofence.

To ensure you can trust a user's location, you can call `Radar.trackVerified()` instead. Radar will collect a variety of fraud signals and perform fraud checks, exposing flags that you can use for fraud detection and location verification in your app.

## Fraud flags

If you call `Radar.trackVerified()`, Radar exposes the following flags in `user.fraud`:
- **`mocked`**: Indicates whether a user's location is being mocked, such as in a simulator or using a location spoofing app (e.g., [Fake GPS location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en_US&gl=US)).
- **`compromised`**: Indicates whether the user's device or app has been compromised according to the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) on Android.
- **`jumped`**: Indicates whether the user moved too far too fast (e.g., "jumped" across the country in only a few seconds).
- **`sharing`**: Indicates whether the user is screen sharing (e.g., using [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/)).
- **`proxy`**: Indicates whether the user's IP address is a known proxy, VPN, Tor exit node, etc.
- **`verified`**: Indicates whether the request was made with [SSL pinning configured successfully](#configuring-ssl-pinning).

While you can work with individual flags, Radar also exposes a single `user.fraud.passed` flag that indicates whether all fraud checks passed.

## Bypassing checks for testing

If desired, you can bypass fraud checks for individual users using the *Mark as Bypassed* button on the user detail page.

If a user is marked as bypassed, `user.fraud.bypassed = true` and `user.fraud.passed = true`, regardless of whether the user passes fraud checks.

## Blocking users

You can also manually block a user using the *Mark as Blocked* button on the user detail page.

If a user is blocked, `user.fraud.blocked = true` and `user.fraud.passed = false`, regardless of whether the user passes fraud checks.

## Allowed states and countries

With [Regions](/documentation/regions), you can mark specific states and countries as allowed or denied to comply with regulations. For example, a gambling app may only be allowed to operate in specific states.

If you call `Radar.trackVerified()`, Radar exposes your settings in `user.country.allowed` and `user.state.allowed`.

## Configuring SSL pinning

To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, you must configure SSL pinning before calling `Radar.trackVerified()`.

On iOS, add the following to your `Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
    <key>NSPinnedDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>api-verified.radar.io</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>
            <key>NSPinnedLeafIdentities</key>
            <array>
                <dict>
                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>
                    <string>15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</string>
                </dict>
                <dict>
                    <key>SPKI-SHA256-BASE64</key>
                    <string>15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</string>
                </dict>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

On Android, add a `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">api-verified.radar.io</domain>
        <pin-set>
            <pin digest="SHA-256">15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</pin>
            <pin digest="SHA-256">15ktYXSSU2llpy7YyCgeqUKDBkjcimK/weUcec960sI=</pin>
        </pin-set>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```

## Configuring the Play Integrity API

On Android, the SDK uses the [Play Integrity API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity) to detect whether the user's device or app has been compromised.

If the user's device or app does not meet [basic integrity checks](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdict#device-integrity-field), `user.fraud.compromised = true`.

You must add the Play Integrity API dependency before calling `Radar.trackVerified()`.

Add the dependency to the `dependencies` section of your app's `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.android.play:integrity:1.0.2'
}
```

If `Radar.trackVerified()` returns `ERROR_FORBIDDEN`, check the logs. The Play Services version on the device may be out of date.

## Verifying user locations

Once the above configuration is complete, you can verify a user's location client-side with just a few lines of code:

<Tabs
  groupId="fraud"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: 'Swift', value: 'swift' },
    { label: 'Kotlin', value: 'kotlin' }
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="swift">

```swift
Radar.trackVerified { (status, location, events, user) in
  if user?.fraud?.passed == true &&
    user?.country?.allowed == true &&
    user?.state?.allowed == true {
    // allow access to feature
  } else {
    // deny access to feature
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
Radar.trackVerified { status, location, events, user ->
  if (user?.fraud?.passed == true &&
    user.country?.allowed == true &&
    user.state?.allowed == true) {
    // allow access to feature
  } else {
    // deny access to feature
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Fraud is not yet supported with `Radar.startTracking()`.

You can also [get a user](/documentation/api#get-a-user) and check fraud flags server-side for an additional layer of verification:

```bash
curl "https://api.radar.io/v1/users/56db1f4613012711002229f4" \
  -H "Authorization: prj_live_sk_..."
```
