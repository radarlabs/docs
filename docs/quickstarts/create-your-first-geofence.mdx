If you haven't done so already, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for a free Radar account to get access to the Radar Dashboard and your API keys.

Creating your first geofence is easy with [Radar's Dashboard](https://radar.com/dashboard); you can also [create geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) through CSV import, the API, nightly sync, or integrations. Your geofences can be created in the *Test* environment for development and testing, and in the *Live* environment for production.

Log in to your Radar account, navigate to the *Manage > Geofences* tab. Select *New* to create your first geofence. You can start creating your geofence by providing an address, searching for a place, or manually placing it using the map.

<Alert alertType="info">
  Be sure to toggle which environment you want to create your geofence in with the <i>environment toggle</i> in the left navigation.
</Alert>

After you've chosen the location for your geofence, you're required to provide:
- **`tag`** (string): a group for the geofence (e.g., `"store"`).
- **`externalId`** (string): an external ID for the geofence that maps to your internal database (e.g., `"123"`).
- **`description`** (string): a display name for the geofence (e.g., `"Store #123"`).

<Alert alertType="info">
  Geofences must be uniquely referenced by the <code>tag</code> and <code>externalId</code> that you provide when creating a geofence.
</Alert>

Choose *circle* to create a circle geofence, *polygon* to create a polygon geofence, or *isochrone* to create an [isochrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map) (time-based) geofence.

You can also optionally add metadata (strings, numbers, or booleans). Lastly, you can choose how events are generated by this geofence (default behavior is when the device [stops](/geofences#stop-detection) within the geofence as opposed to simply passing through it).

Select *Create* to create the geofence. You can view all of your geofences at *Manage > Geofences*.

Now it's time to generate your first Event! [Next guide](/quickstarts/generate-your-first-event)
