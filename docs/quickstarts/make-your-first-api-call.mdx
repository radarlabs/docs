If you haven't done so already, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for a free Radar account to get access to the Radar Dashboard and your API keys. For this quickstart, you'll need your *test publishable* key, so make sure to grab that from the API keys table in the Dashboard.

Radar provides a variety of APIs to build location-based app experiences, including [search](/api#search), [geocoding](/api#geocoding), and [routing](/api#routing). Search your own data or tap into our best-in-class address and place data.

## Search

### Autocomplete

Radar's [autocomplete](/api#autocomplete) endpoint allows you to input a partial address and receive full addresses and place names, sorted by relevance. This functionality can power use cases such as store locators, checkout forms, and supplying pickup or delivery locations. The image below displays the autocomplete interaction:

![Autocomplete UI](/img/quickstarts/autocomplete.png)

To power such an experience, make the below API call:

```bash
curl "https://api.radar.io/v1/search/autocomplete?query=841+Broadway&near=40.70390%2C-73.98670" \
  -H "Authorization: {YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}"
```

For a successful request, you'll receive a response like the following, keyed by the `addresses` field:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "code": 200
  },
  "addresses": [
    {
      "latitude": 40.733674,
      "longitude": -73.991204,
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -73.991204,
          40.733674
        ]
      },
      "country": "United States",
      "countryCode": "US",
      "countryFlag": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
      "distance": 3336,
      "borough": "Manhattan",
      "city": "New York",
      "number": "841",
      "neighborhood": "Greenwich Village",
      "postalCode": "10003",
      "stateCode": "NY",
      "state": "New York",
      "street": "Broadway",
      "layer": "address",
      "formattedAddress": "841 Broadway, Manhattan, New York, NY 10003 USA",
      "addressLabel": "841 Broadway"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Search places

Radar's [places search](/api#search-places) endpoint allows you to search for places near a location, sorted by distance. At least one [chain](/places/chains), such as `"mcdonalds"`, or [category](/places/categories), such as `"shopping-retail"`, is required. This capability can power use cases such as nearby retailers, store locators, and rewards apps. The image below displays the data available from the search places API:

![Places search](/img/quickstarts/search_places.png)

To retrieve this data, make the following API call:

```bash
curl "https://api.radar.io/v1/search/places?chains=target&near=40.7567%2C-73.9889&radius=10000" \
  -H "Authorization: {YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}"
```

For a successful request, you'll receive data similar to the following, keyed by the `places` field:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "code": 200
  },
  "places": [
    {
      "_id": "627ac6c769ec587f48edb546",
      "name": "Target",
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -73.988281,
          40.757069
        ]
      },
      "categories": [
        "shopping-retail",
        "department-store",
        "food-beverage",
        "food-grocery"
      ],
      "chain": {
        "slug": "target",
        "name": "Target",
        "domain": "target.com"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
