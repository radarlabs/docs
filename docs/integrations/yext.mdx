Radar can sync locations from [Yext](http://www.yext.com) as geofences in Radar.

## Configuration

On the Radar [Integrations page](/integrations) under *Yext*, set *Enabled* to *Yes* and optionally configure any additional settings.

### Default Settings
Radar will use the following default mappings when syncing Yext locations to Radar geofences:

Yext Location Field | Radar Geofence Field | Type
--- | --- | ---
`locationName` | `description` | string
`id` | `externalId` | string
`closed.isClosed` | `enabled` | boolean

Radar will use the following default values when syncing Yext locations to Radar geofences:

Radar Geofence Field | Default Value | Type
--- | --- | ---
`type` | `circle` | string (`circle` or `isochrone`)
`tag` | `location` | string
`radius` | `100` (for `circle`) <br/> `15` (for `isochrone`) | number (meters for `circle`, minutes for `isochrone`)

### Additional Settings
You can choose to override certain defaults with additional configuration settings for the [geofences](/geofences) synced from Yext.

The available overrides include:
- Default geofence `type`
- Default geofence `radius`
- An override for the mapping of the `description` field to a different Yext field than `locationName` (e.g. `address`)
- An override for the default `tag` value that will be mapped to a Yext field (e.g. `schemaTypes.0`)

Additionally, you can map up to 16 Yext fields to Radar geofence metadata. Use *dot notation* to access nested Yext fields.  For example, if you have a Yext location with the following property: `"schemaTypes": ["Restaurant"]`, you can store the value `"Restaurant"` by adding `schemaTypes.0` as a *Yext Key*.  If you include a Yext field in the metadata mapping and that field is not found, or the value in Yext is undefined or `null`, the value will not be copied over to the geofence.

### Syncing Data
Once configured, click *Connect & Sync* and you will be redirected to Yext, where you can authorize Radar. Then, you will be redirected back to the Radar [Integrations page](/integrations) with an indication of whether the authorization succeeded or failed.  If the authorization succeeded, your Yext locations will immediately begin syncing to Radar [geofences](/geofences).

Radar will automatically keep geofences in sync when you create or update locations in Yext.  Radar will sync geofences both to the *Test* and *Live* environments.  **If you update the geometry of a geofence in Radar that has been synced with Yext, your changes will not be overwritten in Radar with subsequent updates from Yext.**

Update any of the defaults after the initial sync by changing the integration settings and clicking *Update & Sync*.  Once clicked, a full sync of every Yext location will occur.  **A change in these default overrides will only be reflected for newly created locations in Yext.  Previously synced locations turned geofences will not be updated to the new defaults.**
