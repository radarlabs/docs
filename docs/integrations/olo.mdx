Radar can [start and stop trips](/trip-tracking) for customer arrival tracking when orders are placed, fired, cancelled, or closed in [Olo](https://www.olo.com).

## Configuration

Configure a Olo webhook to deliver to https://api.radar.com/webhooks/olo for the relevant Order Events via the Development Tools section of the Olo Dashboard (requires 2 factor authentication and at least Brand Manager permission). When order events are triggered in Olo, Olo will call the Radar webhook. Collect your brand ID from Olo.

Then, on the Radar [Integrations page](https://radar.com/dashboard/integrations) under *Olo*, set *Enabled* to *Yes* and paste your brand ID. Enter a destination geofence tag (e.g., `restaurant`) and optionally map fields from the Olo webhook body to Radar trip metadata. Select the Olo order events that should trigger trip start and trip stop events.

Finally, on the Radar [Geofences page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofences), [import geofences](/geofences) for your restaurants. For destination geofence tag in the Olo configuration, use the tag used in the restaurant geofence configuration.

Based on your settings, Radar will start and stop trips when orders are placed, fired, cancelled, or closed in Olo. You will need to call `Radar.startTracking()` and `Radar.stopTracking()` to start and stop location tracking in your app when a trip is in progress and `Radar.startTrip()` with just the olo order id as the trip options external Id.

Assuming the customer has granted location permissions and location tracking has been started in your app, Radar will generate location-based `user.approaching_trip_destination` and `user.arrived_at_trip_destination` events and calculate live ETAs to the restaurant for each order.
