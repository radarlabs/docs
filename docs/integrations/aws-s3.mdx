Radar can stream both events and locations to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Use the AWS S3 integration to make Radar data available in a simple object storage format within your own systems, making your locations and events data more easily accessible by your engineers and data scientists.

## Configuration

While in beta, contact your customer success manager to enable this feature.

The AWS S3 integration uses an [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) to stream new Radar locations and events. Additionally, [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) can be used [to encrypt Kinesis data streams server-side](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/server-side-encryption.html).
