[Census](http://www.getcensus.com) can sync locations store in a data warehouse as geofences in Radar, powered by our [upsert geofence API](https://radar.com/documentation/api#upsert-a-geofence). Census supports syncing data from all major data warehouses, including Amazon Athena and Redshift, Snowflake, Azure Synapse, and Google BigQuery.

## Configuration

First, in [Census](http://www.getcensus.com), you'll need to add Radar as a service and copy and paste your Radar secret key from your Radar dashboard under [settings](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings). Be sure include a reference in the name of the service for the environment, *TEST* or *LIVE*, that corresponds to the API key being used.

Second, create a data model and connect your data warehouse as a source.

Third, create a sync and map properties from the data model to [Radar geofence attributes](https://radar.com/documentation/geofences#create-geofences) like `description`, `tag`, `externalId`, `type`, and `radius`.

Finally, schedule a sync.
