Use campaigns to create location-based notifications effortlessly. Campaigns let you customize your notification content and targeting behavior with ease.

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

To use campaigns with geofences, start by [creating geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) through the dashboard, a CSV import, or the API.

To use campaigns with places, ensure that places are enabled through the [settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings) and "nearby places" is activated. Reach out to your account manager to enable "nearby places" for your project. Then setup nearby places for the project via the [settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

Once set up, [create your campaigns](/campaigns#create-campaigns) using the dashboard.

## Create campaigns

To create a campaign via the dashboard, navigate to the [campaigns page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofencing/campaigns) and click **Create**. Provide the campaign's name, notification body, and targeting details. You can target users using either geofences or places.

## Targeting options
Campaigns allow you to target users based on their entry into a geofence or place. Geofences can be targeted using geofence tags or IDs, while places can be targeted by categories or chains. Targeting applies to a user event when all targeting options are true.

You can also target users based on their location-authorization status. For example, you might target a campaign to only target users with foreground-location permission.

Under advanced options, you can find User ID (the [external ID](/sdk/ios#identify-user)) based targeting to target individual users.

## Notification configurations

You can configure the notifications Radar sends to users when they enter a geofence or place. Customize the notification body, and optionally, the notification title and the deep link URL.

## Analytics

With Radar [Conversions](/api#log-a-conversion), you can log an event whenever a user interacts with a campaign notification.

Refer to the [iOS SDK Conversions reference](/sdk/ios#conversions) for setup instructions.

You can also view these campaign conversion analytics by pressing the analytics button on the campaign's page. Alternatively, you can navigate to Geofencing -> Analytics -> Events -> Filters (top right) -> select Type as *opened_app* -> Apply Filters. From there, select *campaign_name* from the *grouped_by* dropdown.

## Frequency Capping

In order to enable frequency capping, you must be running SDK version v3.19.6.

With frequency capping, you can limit the number of notifications a user receives from a campaign. This is useful to prevent excessive notifications for users.
To set up frequency capping, navigate to the [setting page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).
Under the campaigns section, define the maximum number of notifications allowed in the specified time window.
