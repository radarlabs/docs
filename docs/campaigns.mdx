Use campaigns to create location-based notifications effortlessly. Campaigns let you customize your notification content and targeting behavior with ease.

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

To use campaigns with geofences, start by [creating geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) through the dashboard, a CSV import, or the API.

To use campaigns with places, ensure that places are enabled through the [settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings) and "nearby places" is activated. Reach out to your account manager to enable "nearby places" for your project. Then setup nearby places for the project via the [settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

Once set up, [create your campaigns](/campaigns#create-campaigns) using the dashboard.

## Create campaigns

To create a campaign via the dashboard, navigate to the [campaigns page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofencing/campaigns) and click **Create**. Provide the campaign details, targeting options, and notification details.

Notifications will only be delivered if the campaign is set to **Enabled**.

## Notification Types

### Client-side geofence notifications

Radar's client-side geofence notifications make use of location notification triggers on iOS. These triggers work with foreground or <b>"when in use"</b> permissions.
This feature is privacy-friendly and won't collect any additional location data. 
Notifications are only displayed after the user opens the app for the first time with the [Radar SDK](/documentation/sdk) installed.

No additional lines of code are necessary to power client-side geofence notifications. 
They function completely under the hood after setup. 
The same calls to `Radar.trackOnce()` and `Radar.startTracking()` will return nearby geofences with notifications, which will then be registered on the device.

Radar only controls the registration of notifications on the device. 
Once that happens, surfacing notifications is subject to the [system limits and heuristics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unlocationnotificationtrigger#overview) that iOS enforces.

### Event based notifications

Event based notifications are the more traditional type of location-based notifications that rely on background ("Always allow") location permission. These types of notifications often provide less reach, but allow for more insight into conversions and analytics.

## Targeting options

Campaigns allow you to target users based on their entry into a specific type of geofence or place, their location permissions, and specific user IDs. 

Client-side geofence notifications and event based notifications support different targeting options. 

*In order for a notification to be delivered, all targeting options must be true.*

### Geofences and Places targeting

**Geofence tags -** allow you target groups of geofences based on their shared tags

**Geofence external IDs -** allow you to target individual geofences by their unique ID

**Place categories -** allow you to target categories like shopping malls (shopping-mall) or restaurants (restaurant)

**Place chains -** allow you to target specific chains like Starbucks or Target

### Location authorization targeting

Target users based on their device's location-authorization status. For example, you might target a campaign to only target users with foreground-location permission.

### Specific users targeting

Under advanced options, you can find User ID (the [external ID](/sdk/ios#identify-user)) based targeting to target individual users.

## Analytics

*Requires SDK version v3.19.6*

With Radar [Conversions](/api#log-a-conversion), you can log an event whenever a user interacts with a campaign notification.
To enable this for campaigns, make sure `radarInitializationOptions.autoSetupNotificationConversion` = `true`.

Refer to the [iOS SDK Conversions reference](/sdk/ios#conversions) for setup instructions.

You can also view these campaign conversion analytics by pressing the analytics button on the campaign's page. Alternatively, you can navigate to Geofencing -> Analytics -> Events -> Filters (top right) -> select Type as *opened_app* -> Apply Filters. From there, select *campaign_name* from the *grouped_by* dropdown.

## Frequency Capping

*Requires SDK version v3.19.6*

With frequency capping, you can limit the number of notifications a user receives from a campaign. This is useful to prevent excessive notifications for users.
To set up frequency capping, navigate to the [campaign settings](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings#campaigns-settings) within the settings page.

From there, define the maximum number of notifications allowed in the specified time window.

The frequency cap is the maximum number of notifications allowed per user in the specified time window. This includes notifications from **all campaigns**.

The time window is the length of time over which the frequency cap applies. 
This is a rolling time window, so if the frequency cap is 2 and the time window is 48 hours, a notification could be delivered at hour 1, hour 24, and then a third at hour 49.

*There is currently no way to prioritize the delivery of a certain campaign over another.*
