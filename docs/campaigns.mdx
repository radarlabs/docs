Use campaigns to easily customize your notifications. Campaigns can be used to effortlessly customize your notification content and targeting behavior.

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, [create geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) via the dashboard, CSV import, or the API.

Next, [create campaigns](/campaigns#create-campaigns) via the dashboard.

## How it works

Radar's campaigns are a way to customize your notifications. You can use campaigns to customize the content of your notifications, as well as the targeting of your notifications. 
When a user interacts with a geofence, Radar will check to see if there is a campaign associated with that geofence. If there is, Radar will use the campaign's content and targeting to customize the notification that is sent to the user.


## Create campaigns

To create a campaign via the dashboard, go to the [campaigns page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofencing/campaigns) and click the create button. Enter the campaign's name, notification body and targeting information. You can use either your project's geofences tags or geofences ids to target users with a campaign.
