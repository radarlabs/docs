Use campaigns to customize your notifications effortlessly. Campaigns let you tailor your notification content and targeting behavior with ease.

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

To use campaigns with geofences, start by [creating geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) through the dashboard, a CSV import, or the API.

Once set up, [create your campaigns](/campaigns#create-campaigns) using the dashboard.

## How It Works

Radar campaigns enable you to customize both the content and targeting of your notifications. When a user interacts with a geofence, Radar checks for any campaigns linked to that geofence. If a campaign is found, its content and targeting settings are used to personalize the notification sent to the user.

## Create campaigns

To create a campaign via the dashboard, navigate to the [campaigns page](https://radar.com/dashboard/geofencing/campaigns) and click **Create**. Provide the campaign's name, notification body, and targeting details.

## Targeting options
Campaigns allow you to target users based on their entry into a geofence. Geofences can be targeted using geofence tags or IDs.

For more granular control, advanced targeting options are available. These let you target users by their user ID or their location permission status. Simply expand the advanced targeting section to access these features.

## Notification configurations

You can configure the notifications Radar sends to users when they enter a geofence. Customize the notification body, and optionally, the notification title and deep link.
