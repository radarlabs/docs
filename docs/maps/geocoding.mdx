import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Use Radar's geocoding APIs to convert addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates, or vice versa.

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, call one of the geocoding APIs below, either [directly](/documentation/api) or [using the SDK](/documentation/sdk).

From there, use the APIs to build location features in your app or website, such as store locators, address autocomplete, or delivery tracking.

## Endpoints

### Forward geocoding

Use the forward geocoding API to convert addresses to coordinates.

This endpoint is best for complete addresses. For partial addresses, call the [autocomplete API](/documentation/maps/search#autocomplete) instead.

Use cases for this endpoint include converting an address to coordinates to drop a pin on a map or search nearby the address.

See the forward geocoding API reference [here](/documentation/api#forward-geocode).

### Reverse geocoding

Use the reverse geocoding API to convert coordinates to an address.

Use cases for this endpoint include displaying an address for a pin dropped on a map.

See the reverse geocoding API reference [here](/documentation/api#reverse-geocode).

### IP geocoding

Use the IP geocoding API to convert IP address to city, state, and country.

Use cases for this endpoint include localizing content on a website or in an app without requesting location permissions.

See the IP geocoding API reference [here](/documentation/api#ip-geocode).

## Coverage

Radar's geocoding APIs incorporate both open and commercial datasets for maximum coverage at an affordable price relative to alternatives.

The following table describes data coverage for geocoding APIs, by country, for consumer use cases (e.g., store locators) and logistics use cases (e.g., ride sharing, delivery).
