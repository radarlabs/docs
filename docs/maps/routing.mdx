## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, call one of the routing APIs below, either [directly](/documentation/api) or [using the SDK](/documentation/sdk).

From there, use the APIs to build location features in your app or website, such as store locators, address autocomplete, or delivery tracking.

## Endpoints

### Distance

Use the distance API to calculate the travel distance and duration between an origin and a destination. You can specify one or more travel modes, including `foot`, `bike`, and `car`.

Use cases for this endpoint include calculating the distance and duration of a trip from point A to point B, calculating the ETA for a pickup or delivery, or calculating the walking and driving distance to a nearby store.

See the distance API reference [here](/documentation/api#distance).

### Matrix

Use the matrix API to calculate travel distances and durations between multiple origins and destinations.

Use cases for this endpoint include calculating the walking or driving distance to multiple nearby stores (e.g., in a store locator) or optimizing routes.

See the matrix API reference [here](/documentation/api#matrix).

## Coverage

Radar's routing APIs incorporate both open and commercial datasets for maximum coverage at an affordable price relative to alternatives.

The following table describes data coverage for routing APIs, by country, for consumer use cases (e.g., store locators) and logistics use cases (e.g., ride sharing, delivery).
