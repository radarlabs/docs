## Instructions

To get started, you'll need a Radar account. Don't have a Radar account yet? [Sign up](https://radar.com/signup) first.

1. Download the app from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-toolkit/id1179413551?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store (iOS)</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onradar.app" target="_blank">Play Store (Android)</a>.

2. Open the app and grant notification permissions and location permissions.

3. Copy your `Test Publishable` key from the *Keys* section of the [Settings page](https://radar.com/settings) and paste it into the app.

4. To track in the background, turn on *Tracking* (it is on by default). Then, select the *Tracking Options* preset to use, one of *Efficient*, *Responsive*, or *Continuous*. Learn about [iOS tracking presets](/sdk/tracking#ios-presets) and [Android tracking presets](//sdk/tracking#android-presets). Finally, on the notifications you want to receive, including *Events* (events received from Radar), *Locations* (location updates sent to Radar), and *Errors* (network, location, and permissions errors).

5. Close the *Settings* screen.

6. To track once in the foreground, tap the refresh button! **If you correctly granted permissions and pasted your API key, and if you have connectivity, you will see your current state in the app and see your user on the [Users page](https://radar.com/users) in the dashboard.** If you are in a geofence or at a place, you will see events in the app and see events on the [Events page](https://radar.com/events) in the dashboard.

6. To track in the background, move more than 100 meters! Depending on the *Tracking Options* preset you selected, your location will update in the background. **Note that location updates may be delayed significantly by Android [Doze Mode and App Standby](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby.html), iOS [Low Power Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234), or if the device has connectivity issues, low battery, or wi-fi disabled.**
