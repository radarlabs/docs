Insights predicts a user's home and work locations and detects when a user is at home, at work, traveling, or commuting.

Insights provides the following user context:

```json
{
  insights: {
    state: {
      home: false,
      office: false,
      traveling: true,
      commuting: false
    },
    locations: [
      {
        type: "home",
        coordinates: [
          -73.977797,
          40.783826
        ],
        confidence: 3
      },
      {
        type: "office",
        coordinates: [
          -73.977797,
          40.783826
        ],
        confidence: 3
    ]
  }
}
```

Insights also provides the following events:

- `user.entered_home`
- `user.exited_home`
- `user.entered_office`
- `user.exited_office`
- `user.started_traveling`
- `user.stopped_traveling`
- `user.started_commuting`
- `user.stopped_commuting`

You can receive events client-side via the [SDK](/sdk) or server-side via [event integrations](/integrations), including webhooks.

Insights is available on the [Enterprise](https://radar.com/pricing) plan.

You can enable Insights on the [Settings page](https://radar.com/dashboard/settings).

## How it works

When Insights is on, Radar stores and clusters historical location data for each user. Based on the size, location, and time distribution of clusters, Radar learns a user's approximate home and office locations after a few days.

Radar generates a home or office entry event if a user enters their predicted home or office location with sufficient confidence, then a home or office exit event when the user leaves their predicted home or office location with sufficient confidence.

Radar also generates a traveling started event if a user travels more than 100 kilometers from their predicted home location, then a traveling stopped event when the user returns.

If a user is at their predicted home or office location, Radar will not generate a place entry event. Learn more about [Places](/places).

## Confidence

All insights events have confidence levels. Confidence levels range from `1` (low) to `3` (high). Confidence is based on the size and time distribution of clusters.

On average, Radar learns a user's approximate home and office locations after a few days. In the foreground, Radar needs location data from a few app opens. In the background, Radar needs location data from a few days of activity.

When confidence is low, a user's approximate home and office locations may be the same until they start to diverge over time.

You may decide to ignore insights based on confidence levels.

## Verify events

You can accept or reject insights events after user check-ins or other forms of verification. Event verifications will be used to improve the accuracy and confidence level of future events.

For example, to accept an event on iOS:

```swift
Radar.acceptEventId(event._id, verifiedPlaceId: nil)
```
