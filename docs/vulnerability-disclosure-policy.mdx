Radar operates a private vulnerability bug bounty program administered by HackerOne.  If you submitted a vulnerability after January 1, 2021 directly to Radar under the previous vulnerability disclosure program, those findings have been triaged and you will be contacted about the status of your disclosure by October 31, 2021.
