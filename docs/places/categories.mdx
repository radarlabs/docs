Places may have one or more categories. Radar supports hundreds of categories, organized in a hierarchy. Top-level category slugs are:

<TopLevelCategories />

If a place has a subcategory, it will also have all parent categories above it in the hierarchy. For example, a place with the subcategory slug `fast-food-restaurant` will also have the parent category slug `restaurant` and `food-beverage`.

The full list of supported categories is below. If you find a category that is missing or incorrect, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@radar.io">support@radar.io</a> to let us know.
