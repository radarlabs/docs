Use Radar's on-premise notifications to display a notification when a user enters a geofence. Notifications work even with only foreground or <b>"when in use"</b> permissions!

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, [create geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) via the dashboard, CSV import, or the API.

From there, add values for the following `metadata` keys to the geofences that will trigger notifications.

###### Metadata keys
- **`radar:notificationText`** (string, required): The body text of the notification.
- **`radar:notificationTitle`** (string, optional): The title of the notification, displayed in bold.

Finally, [integrate the SDK](/documentation/sdk) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Make sure that the `syncGeofences` [tracking option](/sdk/tracking#ios) is enabled. Radar will display a notification on the first location update inside of a geofence that has the above `metadata` keys.

## How it works

Radar's on-premise notifications make use of location notification triggers on iOS. These triggers work with only foreground or <b>"when in use"</b> permissions. This feature is privacy-friendly and won't collect any location data or display notifications unless the user opens the app.

No additional lines of code are necessary to power on-premise notifications. They function completely under the hood after setup. The same calls to `Radar.trackOnce()` and `Radar.startTracking()` will return nearby geofences with notifications, which will then be registered on the device.

## Analytics

With Radar [Conversions](/api#log-a-conversion), you can log a metric whenever a user interacts with a notification.

Add the [following line](https://github.com/radarlabs/radar-sdk-ios/blob/master/RadarSDK/Include/Radar.h#L558-L564) to your `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` implementation to instrument `opened_notification` events.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
  func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                              didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
                              withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {

    Radar.logConversion(request: response.notification.request)
  }
}
```
